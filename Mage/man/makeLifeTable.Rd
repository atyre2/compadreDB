\title{
A function to produce a life table from a matrix population model
}
\description{
This function uses age-from-stage approximation methods to calculate a life table.
}
\usage{
makeLifeTable(matU, matF = NULL, matC = NULL, startLife = 1, nSteps = 1000)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{matU}{
The U matrix - growth and survival transitions.
}
  \item{matF}{
The F matrix - sexual reproduction
}
  \item{matC}{
The C matrix - clonal reproduction
}
  \item{startLife}{
The stage of the matrix where life is considered to begin. This is usually 1 (the first stage), but in species with a seed stage (or other propagule or dormant stage), may be 2 or more.
}
  \item{nSteps}{
For how many time steps should the life table be constructed.
}
}
\details{
A detailed description of these methods can be found in the supplementary information of Jones et al. (2014) and in section 5.3 of Caswell (2001).
}
\value{
A `data.frame` with between 2 and 4 columns.
If just `matU` is provided, the `data.frame` has columns `x` (age), `lx` (survivorship). 
If `matF` is provided (in addition to `matU`), `mx` (age-specific sexual reproduction) is included in the output `data.frame`. Likewise, if `matC` is provided, an addition column, `cx` (age-specific clonal reproduction) is included.
