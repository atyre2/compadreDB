# Workshop materials on the COMADRE and COMPADRE matrix databases.

These databases together contain several thousand (mostly) published matrix population models (MPMs) for species from across the diverse tree of life.

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to the databases and explain their structure and how one can use them to obtain MPMs from particular species of interest, and groups of species for comparative demographic analyses.

## What the workshop material covers

- Introduction - what are COMADRE and COMPADRE?
- Structure of the database
- What metadata are included?
- Querying the database
- Conducting some large-scale comparative analysis

The suggested order that you tackle these worksheets is:

1. Obtaining_An_MPM.pdf
2. PlotALifeCycleDiagram.pdf
3. SimpleOutputs.pdf
4. GeographicDistribution.pdf
5. TernaryPlots.pdf
6. AgeFromStage.pdf
