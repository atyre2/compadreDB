# General Instructions

## Database Organization

The data associated with COMADRE are provided in a single R data object (extension .Rdata). In addition, these files are accompanied by R scripts and a nexus phylogeny available in the Supplementary Information of the manuscript introducing COMADRE, and in our github repository (https://github.com/jonesor/COMPADREDB)

* COMADRE_v_MAJOR_MINOR_PATCH.RData: Contains basic information regarding the source of publication, as well as ecological, biogeographic, and taxonomic details of the demographic study for each study species, the demographic information (i.e. the matrix population model) and metadata.

## The meanings of NA in COMADRE

NA in the COMADRE data generally means that the data are not available/applicable. This could be because the data were not reported by the author(s), or it could mean that the data have not yet been digitized for this version of COMADRE. It could also mean that the data are not applicable in this case (e.g. where data are derived from several geographic locations we do not report a single average latitude/longitude value) 


## Disclaimer 

The COMADRE digitization team does its best to ensure data accuracy, and every piece of information goes through multiple error-checks prior to its release in www.comadre-db.org. However, we claim no responsibility for any damage that may arise from using COMADRE.  A list of error checks and potential issues in the use and interpretation of the database are described in the main manuscript. The end user is ultimately responsible for his/her interpretations of the data.

* `Indivisible` -	The matrix population model **A** has **not** been divided into the process-based sub-matrices **U**, **F** and **C** because insufficient information is available to classify the various demographic processes for each sub-matrix. In indivisible matrices, only **A** has values given - the other matrices are filled with **NA** values.

-----------------------------------------------


### `MatrixFec`

**Definition:** Whether reproduction was modeled by the MPM.

##### Possible values:

* `prop` -	Propagule. This applies to every stage defined by the author as a spore-like stage. Users are encouraged to carefully examine matrices with these stages and to implement the appropriate calculations to avoid a spurious additional year being added when no additional gap-years exists in the study species, as explained by Caswell (2001, p. 60).

A range of numeric values are possible, but are constrained to be positive. These include only estimates of sexual reproduction (no clonal reproduction). 

The values are only digitized for `Divided` matrices (indicated by variable `MatrixSplit`)

-----------------------------------------------


### `matC`

# Appendix - The calculation of mean matrix population models

*	In COMADRE we present the individual matrix population models for each season, year, study population and treatment that can be calculated from a paper, as well as those personally communicated by the publication authors to the COMADRE digitization team.  When pertinent, mean matrix population models that are element-by-element averages (arithmetic mean) across all Unmanipulated matrix population models (defined above) and across each treatment group are also given. Mean matrix population models that combine estimates from different treatments, or that combine estimates from treatments with unmanipulated conditions, are not calculated because of their lack of biological interpretation (Figure 2).

*	Seasonal matrix population models, where more than one matrix  population model exists for a single year, are marked as “Seasonal”.  For these, we calculate average matrix population models for each season but not for each year (Figure 3). Deriving an annual model from  seasonal data is straightforward and the calculations are described by Caswell (2001, p. 349).

-----------------------------------------------

![mean matrices](images/Fig2.png)

**Figure 2.** *Schematic showing how mean population matrix models are derived from all available population matrix models in a study.* **A.** *For annual population matrix models (those that follow population dynamics from one year to the next, or sometimes more – some tree species are studied with a 5-year interval), element-by-element means are first calculated across the population matrix models describing the population dynamics for time periods within each population. Then the grand element-by-element mean is calculated across the matrix population models for the different populations. This procedure is repeated for models describing dynamics under each imposed treatment (pink matrices below) and for those describing the dynamics of unmanipulated populations (gray). Note that mean population matrix models are only calculated from population matrix models that share the same treatment (or absence of treatment).* **B.** *For seasonal or periodic population matrix models (e.g. for annual species), the mean seasonal population matrix model is calculated within populations and then across populations, both for matrices describing treated populations and for those describing populations with no imposed treatment (i.e. unmanipulated).*






![A life cycle](images/Fig3.png)
**Figure 3.** *Life cycle of two hypothetical animal populations based on age* (**A**) *and size* (**B**)*, with their corresponding matrix population models A, and underlying basic demographic processes of survival (U sub-matrix; solid arrows), sexual reproduction (F sub-matrix; dashed arrows) and clonal reproduction (C sub-matrix; dotted arrows). In the Leslie matrix model example* (**A**) *, the division of sub-matrices is more straightforward than in the Lefkovitch matrix model example * (**B**)*. In the latter imaginary example, individuals can transition into the same stage as they can contribute with sexual and/or clonal offspring (e.g. small stage). In these cases, splitting A into sub-matrices U, F and C is only feasible when sufficient information is provided by the authors (see variable `MatrixSplit` in above). *
